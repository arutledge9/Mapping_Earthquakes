# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Summary

I have been helping my friends, Basil and Sadhana, map earthquakes that have occurred across the planet over the past 7 days. For our final work together, we decided to add on to our map to include three map tile layer options (Streets, Satellite, and Dark), as well as include options to toggle views for Earthquakes, Tectonic Plates, and Major Earthquakes of 4.5 magnitude or higher. 

Sadhana also was gracious enough to show me the basic ropes of creating GitHub staging branches and merging them with my main branch, so I have been practicing that process as I've gone through each stage of my map work.
